# ETL Process and Challenge
The goal of this project is to show my process in preforming ETL on a new dataset and how to find errors we would want to remove before preforming any analysis. This dataset was part of a challenge through SuperDataScience, a platform that teaches data science and business intelligence tools. In this process we will be using a combination of NotePad++, Excel, SSIS, and SQL to try to find errors in the data that would skew our analysis. Note that on Macs the process would be slightly different, NotePad++, SSIS, and SQL are programs that only run on Windows. There are other available solutions like Atom/Brackets as your text editor and PostgreSQL for SQL. I may choose to run this process on a Mac in another post since I also do work with my MacBook Pro.

The dataset is just over 1.05M rows and has 5 errors that we need to try to find. Below is the only info we were given in the challenge.

1. The CustomerID field does not contain duplicate records.
2. You know that the total projected revenue for 2016 equals: $419,896,187.87
3. Give a small explanation to how the error might of occurred.
